Selection Sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from an unsorted part of the list and places it at the beginning. 
This algorithm is easy to understand and suitable for educational purposes but is not as efficient as other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort for large datasets.
This project is implemented in:
Programming Languages: Can be implemented in languages like Python, C++, or R.
Dependencies: None – it’s a standalone algorithm that does not require any libraries.
Selection Sort algorithm steps:
Start at the first element of the list.
Search the entire list for the smallest (or largest) element.
Swap it with the first unsorted element.
Move the boundary between sorted and unsorted sections one element forward.
Repeat until the entire list is sorted.
